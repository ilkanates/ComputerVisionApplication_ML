Advanced Computer Vision Applications
This project presents two advanced computer vision applications: face recognition and product detection. The project uses Python and the OpenCV library to implement these applications.

Objectives
Face Recognition
The face recognition application is designed to detect employees who come to work using facial recognition instead of using cards. This application can improve security, reduce the risk of lost or stolen cards, and increase efficiency.

Product Detection
The product detection application is designed to implement image processing to detect boxes containing the company's products on the production line. This application can improve quality control in production lines, save time and money, and increase efficiency and accuracy.

Weekly Production
The project includes information on weekly production quantities:

Weekly Production Quantity: 500,000
Weekly Production Box Quantity: 50,000
Weekly Production Work Order Quantity: 50
Libraries
The project uses the following libraries:

Face Recognition
OpenCV
face_recognition
glob
Product Detection
OpenCV
CascadeClassifier
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how advanced computer vision applications can be used to replace card scanning, improve quality control in production lines, save time and money, and increase efficiency and accuracy. As technology continues to advance, there will likely be more opportunities to incorporate AI and machine learning into business processes to drive innovation and growth.
